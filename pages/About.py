st.title("ðŸ’§ Fresh Water Quality Detector (FWD)")
st.markdown("The Fresh Water Quality Detector (FWD) is a machine learning model that uses XGBoost to predict the quality of fresh water. The model is trained on various water quality parameters such as pH, iron, nitrate, chloride, lead, zinc, color, turbidity, fluoride, copper, odor, sulfate, conductivity, chlorine, manganese, total dissolved solids, source, water temperature, air temperature, month, day, and time of day. The goal of the FWD model is to provide a quick and reliable method of detecting the quality of fresh water.")
st.markdown("XGBoost is a gradient boosting framework that uses a tree-based algorithm to perform both regression and classification tasks. It is a powerful and efficient algorithm that is widely used in machine learning competitions and real-world problems. XGBoost is well-suited for this task because it can handle large datasets with a high number of features and provide accurate predictions.")
st.markdown("To use the FWD model, simply input the various water quality parameters and let the XGBoost algorithm do the rest. The model will provide a prediction on the quality of the water sample, which can be used to make informed decisions about the usage and treatment of the water.")
st.markdown("ðŸ’¦ With the Fresh Water Quality Detector, you can have peace of mind knowing that the water you're using is safe and of good quality.")
